# database101

# Basic Description:
This repo is used for me to get to know the SQL database structure and add, change and delete information with the database with python. As an example, this code is used to administrate a library.

# The Project
The project has one main file, which inherits the functions to:
- create user
- pick a random user from the database
- pick a random book from the database
- review a random book from the database
- checkout a random book from the database

The database is populated with fake data.
